Goal
Due to the recent boost in AI world, companies have started researching the possibility of using machine learning in place of tranditional approach.

Tuning traditional algorithms takes a significant amount of effords and domain expertise as well.

In this repo, we are trying to figure out a way of predict the same using machine learning algorithms.

Data
The dataset comprised of units sold on a daily basis along with details regarding the sales, eg. SKU(product id), Store, price etc.

record_ID, week, store_id, sku_id, total_price, base_price, is_featured_sku, is_display_sku, units_sold

Workflow
Handling missing values
Feature selection based on my previous experience in Supply chain domain
Converting dataset into time series format to apply supervised learning approach.
Regression Modeling
Random Forest
XGBoost
SVM (future scope)
Hyperparameter Tuning
